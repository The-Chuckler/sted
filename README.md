<h1> What is this piece of software?? </h1>
<h2> And why is it so tiny?? </h2>


This is the amazing "sted", a quite small text editor written in standard C.

It is made as an effort to engrave C better in my (i.e repo owner's) brain.

If you wish to help develop this piece of software, I suggest you let me (you-know-who) know via email. I (think u got it) rarely check on github for any news.

This has been developed in the past as a local project, but after deleting it twice, has been moved to github and being redone.

Thank you for reading. There will be no releases, as this is as simple to compile as "tcc main.c" as of now.

Â¡The end!
